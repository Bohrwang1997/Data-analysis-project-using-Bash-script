 This project involves creating four Bash shell script files named cyber_breaches, maxstate, a file corresponding to a two-letter state code, and another corresponding to a four-digit year. The cyber_breaches file is designed to execute different commands, with one of four specific commands required as the second argument for each invocation. The maxstate script reports the state code with the highest number of incidents across all years, along with the corresponding count. If there are multiple states with the same maximum incident count, only one is reported. The maxyear script reports the year with the greatest number of incidents across all states and its count. Similarly, for the two-letter state code and four-digit year files, they output the year or state with the maximum incidents and the corresponding count if there are multiple instances.
